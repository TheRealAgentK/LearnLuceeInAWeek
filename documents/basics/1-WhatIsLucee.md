# What is Lucee?

Lucee is a rapid development platform for building modern web applications on the Java Virtual Machine. Lucee is designed to be expressive and powerful and provides two languages: The Lucee language as well as a compatibility extension for continuing support of CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language). The expressive characteristic of both languages allows you to perform programming tasks at a higher level than a lot of other languages. 

The Lucee platform is built on Java and is agnostic of any particular JEE application server or servlet container. The non-profit Lucee Association Switzerland (LAS) (that is the stalwart of Lucee) has decided that Lucee needs to be able to run on any specification-compliant engine without any built-in customisation necessary on the side of Lucee.

Lucee is provided in a variety of formats. You can build Lucee from the source, but that is quite advanced stuff. If that doesn't shock you, have a look at the [instructions to build Lucee from the source](). The easiest option is to download [Lucee Express](). Lucee Express will essentially provide Apache Tomcat with Lucee already deployed into it and ready to go on Tomcat's internal HTTP server on port 8888 on your computer. Other options include .jar and .war files ready to deploy into your platform of choice as well as installers provided by a third party that guide users through the process of setting up Lucee and connecting it with the HTTP server of your choice for you.

While you can have full access to Java and the internals of your JEE platform or servlet container, there's no need to worry about these details. You'll interact with Lucee and the user friendly Lucee language and/or CFML to write your programs. Your Lucee files will use the file extension '.lc' (CFML uses '.cfc' for objects and '.cfm' for pages). Both Lucee and CFML require much less ceremony and infrastructure than typical Java while offering a significantly faster development experience than Java.

After taking this 'Lucee in a week' series, you'll have the basics necessary to begin making dynamic web sites, building intranet applications, or even working on the next Facebook competitor!
