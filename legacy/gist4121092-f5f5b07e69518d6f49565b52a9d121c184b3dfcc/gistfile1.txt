	In this hands on, you are going to add some conditional logic to the site as well as create a form post.

		<li>
			Open up the <span class="code">/www/contact.cfm</span> file in your code editor.
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the comment that reads <span class="code">Message Output</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Below the comment, create a <span class="code">&lt;cfif></span> statement that checks if the <span class="code">form.submitted</span> variable is true. Your code should look something like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;cfif form.submitted&gt;
					
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Inside the <span class="code">&lt;cfif></span> tag, place the text &lt;p>Your form has been submitted&lt;/p>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Navigate to the <span class="code">/www/contact.cfm</span> page in your browser.
		</li>
		<li>
			Notice that you receive an error stating that 'Element Submitted is undefined in form'. This error is thrown because the <span class="code">form.submitted</span> variable does not exist. When dealing with forms, it is important to provide <span class="code">&lt;cfparam></span> tags that will create the variable if it is not already defined.
		</li>
		<li>
			Go to line 1 of <span class="code">contact.cfm</span> and add the following line of code:
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;cfparam name="form.submitted" default="0" /&gt;
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the page in your browser and notice that the error has been resolved.
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the <span class="code">&lt;form></span> tag on or around line 109.
		</li>
		<li>
			Update the <span class="code">action</span> attribute to point to <span class="code">contact.cfm</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the page in your browser and click the submit button.
		</li>
		<li>
			Notice that the form was submitted but the text was not displayed. This is because the <span class="code">form.submitted</span> value still does not exist, and the <span class="code">&lt;cfparam></span> is setting that value for us.
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the closing <span class="code">&lt;form></span> tag on or around line 130.
		</li>
		<li>
			Before the closing <span class="code">&lt;/form></span> tag, add a hidden input called <span class="code">submitted</span> and give it a value of '1'. The tag should look similar to this:
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;input type="hidden" name="submitted" value="1" /&gt;
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the page in your browser and click the submit button.
		</li>
		<li>
			You should now see the text "Your form has been submitted" displayed on the page.
		</li>
	</ol>
